## The InternalFluidFlow Module for Julia

InternalFluidFlow provides the following functions:

- Re2f
- f2Re
- hDeps2fDRe
- hveps2fDRe
- hQeps2fDRe
- hvthk2fDRe
- hQthk2fDRe

### Re2f

Re2f computes the Darcy friction factor, given
the Reynolds number and
the relative roughness.

By default, pipe is assumed to be smooth,
relative roughness is eps=0.
If eps > 0.05, eps is reset to eps=0.05.

If fig = true is given, a schematic Moody diagram
is plotted as a graphical representation
of the solution.

**Syntax:**

```dotnetcli
f=Re2f(Re::Number,eps::Number=0,fig::Bool=false)
```

**Examples:**

Compute the Darcy friction factor f given
the Reynolds number Re = 120,000 and
the relative roughness eps = 0.001:

```julia
Re = 1.2e5;
f=Re2f(Re,eps=1e-3)
```

Compute f and plot a schematic Moody diagram:

```julia
f=Re2f(1.2e5,eps=1e-3,fig=true)
```

### f2Re

f2Re computes the Reynolds number, given
the Darcy friction factor and
the relative roughness for
for laminar regime and,
when possible, also
for turbulent regime.

By default, pipe is assumed to be smooth,
relative roughness is eps=0.
If eps > 0.05, eps is reset to eps=0.05.

If turb = true is given and
both laminar and turbulent regimes are possible,
then f2Re returns the number of Reynolds
for turbulent regime alone.

If fig = true is given, a schematic Moody diagram
is plotted as a graphical representation
of the solution.

**Syntax:**

```dotnetcli
Re=f2Re(f::Number,eps::Number=0,fig::Bool=false,isturb::Bool=false)
```

**Examples:**

Compute the Reynolds number Re given
the Darcy friction factor f = 0.028 and
the relative roughness eps = 0.001.
In this case, both laminar and turbulent
solutions are possible:

```julia
f = 2.8e-2;
Re=f2Re(f,eps=1e-3)
```

Compute Re and plot a schematic Moody diagram:

```julia
Re=f2Re(2.8e-2,eps=1e-3,fig=true)
```

the head loss,
the pipe's hydraulic diameter,

is plotted as a graphical representation
of the solution.
