## The InternalFluidFlow Module for Julia

Internal Fluid Flow provides the following functions:

- Re2f
- f2Re
- hDeps2fDRe
- hveps2fDRe
- hQeps2fDRe
- hvthk2fDRe
- hQthk2fDRe

### Re2f

Re2f computes the Darcy friction f factor, given
the Reynolds number Re and
the relative roughness eps.

By default, pipe is assumed to be smooth, eps = 0.
If eps > 0.05, eps is reset to eps = 0.05.

If fig=true is given, a schematic Moody diagram
is plotted as a graphical representation
of the solution.

**Syntax:**

```dotnetcli
f=Re2f(Re[,eps[,fig]])
```

**Examples:**

Compute the Darcy friction factor f given
the Reynolds number Re = 120,000 and
the relative roughness eps = 0.001:

```julia
Re=1.2e5;eps=1e-3;
f=Re2f(Re,eps)
```

Compute f and plot a schematic Moody diagram:

```julia
f=Re2f(1.2e5,1e-3,true)
```

Compute the Darcy friction factor f given
the Reynolds number Re = 120,000
for a smooth tube and plot
a schematic Moody diagram
with the solution:

```julia
f=Re2f(1.2e5,:,true)
```

### f2Re

f2Re computes the Reynolds number Re, given
the Darcy friction factor f and
the relative roughness eps for
for laminar regime and,
when possible, also
for turbulent regime.

By default, pipe is assumed to be smooth, eps = 0.
If eps > 0.05, eps is reset to eps = 0.05.

If fig=true is given, a schematic Moody diagram
is plotted as a graphical representation
of the solution.

**Syntax:**

```dotnetcli
Re=f2Re(f[,eps[,fig]])
```

**Examples:**

Compute the Reynolds number Re given
the Darcy friction factor f = 0.028 and
the relative roughness eps = 0.001.
In this case, both laminar and turbulent
solutions are possible:

```julia
f=2.8e-2;eps=1e-3;
Re=f2Re(f,eps)
```

Compute Re and plot a schematic Moody diagram:

```julia
Re=f2Re(2.8e-2,1e-3,true)
```

Compute the Reynolds number Re given
